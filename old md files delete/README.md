# Clinic Starter

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." - Steve Jobs

A minimalist medical clinic website where Steve Jobs Archive aesthetics meet healthcare excellence. Built with obsessive attention to detail and radical simplicity.

## Philosophy

> "Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think it's this veneer – that the designers are handed this box and told, 'Make it look good!' That's not what we think design is. It's not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works." - Steve Jobs

### Why We're Different

While others add features, we remove them. While others chase trends, we pursue timelessness. This isn't just another medical website template – it's a philosophical statement about how healthcare should present itself digitally.

**Our Innovations:**

1. **Two-Color Universe**: Inspired by Dieter Rams and the Steve Jobs Archive, we use only black and white (with their 98%/2% variants). This isn't limitation – it's liberation. Medical information needs clarity, not decoration.

2. **Component Scarcity as Feature**: Just 11 components. Not because we couldn't build more, but because constraint breeds creativity. As Jony Ive said: "Simplicity is not the absence of clutter; simplicity is somehow essentially describing the purpose and place of an object and product."

3. **Performance as Ethics**: Sub-100ms interactions aren't a technical achievement – they're a moral imperative. Every millisecond of delay is a moment stolen from patient care.

4. **Typography as Humanity**: Two fonts only. LavaChicken Serif for the soul, Inter for the science. As Ive noted: "We try to develop products that seem somehow inevitable."

## Vision

> "Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower." - Steve Jobs

Creating the future of medical web presence through:
- **Extreme Minimalism**: 2-color palette, 2 fonts, 11 components
- **Performance Obsession**: Sub-100ms interactions
- **Privacy First**: Zero tracking by default
- **International Ready**: Built for global healthcare

## Design Philosophy

> "The quest for simplicity has to pervade every part of the process. It really is fundamental." - Jony Ive

### The Three Pillars

1. **Inevitability Through Constraint**
   - Every element must justify its existence
   - If you can remove it without losing function, it shouldn't exist
   - "Deciding what not to do is as important as deciding what to do." - Steve Jobs

2. **Honesty in Interface**
   - No dark patterns, no manipulation
   - Clear information hierarchy
   - "When you're a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you're not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall." - Steve Jobs

3. **Respect Through Performance**
   - Every interaction under 100ms
   - Every page load under 1 second
   - "Details matter, it's worth waiting to get it right." - Steve Jobs

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15.3.3** - React 19 with App Router
- **Tailwind CSS 4.1.10** - CSS-first configuration with @theme
- **TypeScript 5** - Strict type safety
- **shadcn/ui** - 11 components only (by design)
- **tw-animate-css** - Native CSS animations

## Design System

> "Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it's really how it works." - Steve Jobs

### Typography
- **Display**: LavaChicken Serif (custom variable font)
- **Body**: Inter (subset, optimized)

### Colors
Inspired by stevejobsarchive.com:
- **Light Mode**: #f9f9f9 background (98% lightness)
- **Dark Mode**: #050505 background (2% lightness)
- **Text**: Pure black/white contrast
- **Overlays**: Subtle light grey (Steve Jobs Archive style)

### Component Constraint (11 Maximum)
> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." - Leonardo da Vinci (Steve Jobs' favorite quote)

1. `navigation-menu` - Desktop navigation
2. `sheet` - Mobile menu/drawer
3. `button` - All CTAs
4. `dialog` - Modal windows
5. `drawer` - Bottom sheets
6. `form` - Form validation wrapper
7. `input` - Text inputs
8. `textarea` - Multi-line inputs
9. `select` - Dropdowns
10. `label` - Form labels
11. `sonner` - Toast notifications

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development server
npm run dev

# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Production build
npm run build

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

## Project Structure

```
/app              # Next.js app router
/components/ui    # shadcn/ui components (11 max)
/components/layout # Shared layout components
/lib              # Utilities and constants
/types            # TypeScript definitions
/public           # Static assets
```

## Core Principles

> "That's been one of my mantras — focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple." - Steve Jobs

1. **Performance**: Every millisecond matters
2. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.2 AA minimum
3. **Privacy**: GDPR-compliant, consent-first
4. **Security**: OWASP headers, CSP enabled
5. **SEO**: Schema.org medical markup
6. **Minimalism**: If it's not essential, remove it

## Why This Matters

> "The way we approach design is by trying to achieve the most with the very least. We try to simplify, simplify, simplify." - Jony Ive

In healthcare, complexity kills. Not metaphorically – literally. Confused patients miss appointments. Unclear interfaces hide critical information. Slow websites waste precious time that could be spent on care.

This starter represents a different path:
- **No feature creep**: Every addition must replace something else
- **No decoration**: Every pixel must serve a purpose
- **No compromise**: Performance and accessibility are non-negotiable

## Development Philosophy

> "I think there is a profound and enduring beauty in simplicity; in clarity, in efficiency. True simplicity is derived from so much more than just the absence of clutter and ornamentation. It's about bringing order to complexity." - Jony Ive

Every decision must answer: **Does this help patients get healthier faster?**

### What We Don't Do
- ❌ Carousels or sliders ("If you need a carousel, you have too much content")
- ❌ Stock photos ("Real or nothing")
- ❌ Marketing popups ("Respect the user's intent")
- ❌ Decorative animations ("Motion with purpose only")
- ❌ Feature creep ("Start with no and work backwards")

### What We Obsess Over
- ✅ Load time under 1 second ("Performance is a feature")
- ✅ Interaction under 100ms ("Instant is the only acceptable speed")
- ✅ Clear medical information ("Clarity saves lives")
- ✅ Patient privacy ("Trust is our currency")
- ✅ Universal accessibility ("Design for everyone")

## Contributing

> "It's better to be a pirate than to join the navy." - Steve Jobs

Before contributing, read [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) to understand our design philosophy and technical constraints.

Key rules:
1. No new components without removing one
2. Every feature must improve patient outcomes
3. Performance budgets are non-negotiable
4. Accessibility is not optional
5. Question everything, especially your own additions

## The Component Paradox

> "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

We have 11 components not because we need 11, but because we couldn't function with 10. Each component earns its place through constant justification. This is not a technical limitation – it's a philosophical stance.

## Deployment

Optimized for Vercel edge deployment:

```bash
# Production deployment
vercel --prod

# Preview deployment
vercel
```

Environment variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` - Your production URL
- Additional medical API keys as needed
